Why
===

Han Han (韩寒) writes great article about the China's problem. [His
blog](http://blog.sina.com.cn/twocold) is on Sina which does export full RSS. So
I created this to convert the excerpt RSS to a FULL RSS.

Thanks to [hpricot](https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot), this is really easy to do.

I put this script on a web hosting server and use cron job to update the static
full RSS file regular.
