Why
===

Han Han writes great article about the Chinese society's problem. His blog is on
Sina which does export full RSS. So I created this to convert the excerpt RSS to
a FULL RSS.

Thanks to [hpricot](https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot), this is really easy to do.

I put this script on a web hosting server and use cron job to update the static
full RSS file regular.
